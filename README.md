# 🔥❄️ Ultimate Temperature Transformer 3000™ ❄️🔥

Welcome to the **Ultimate Temperature Transformer 3000™**, the only Python-powered converter that's hotter than the sun and cooler than an ice bath — all at once!

With a dash of math and a sprinkle of Python 🐍, this script transforms your temperatures like a wizard with a weather wand 🧙‍♂️🌡️.

---

## 🧠 What Does It Do?

This script converts between:
- 🌡️ **Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit**
- 🧊 **Celsius ↔ Kelvin**
- 🔥 **Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin**
- 🧪 **Kelvin ↔ Fahrenheit**

Just tell it your temperature and what unit you're using, and it’ll shout back the converted values — nice and toasty (or frosty)!

---

## 🚀 How To Use

1. Make sure Python is installed. (If not, what are you even doing here?)
2. Run the script:
```bash
python temperature_converter.py
3. Input your temperature and unit when prompted.
4. Bask in the glory of instant temperature conversions.
```
Example:
```bash
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin): Celsius
Result:  {'Fahrenheit': '77.00 F', 'Kelvin': '298.15 K'}
```
🧪 Supported Units
You can enter any of the following (case insensitive):

Celsius

Fahrenheit

Kelvin

Try typing kelvin, KELVIN, or even KeLvIn. It’s not picky, just chill.

## 😬 What It Doesn’t Like
- Letters instead of numbers 😤
- Units like "Celciuz" or "Farenthyte" 🙈
- Negative Kelvin values... because, well, physics.

🛠️ Behind the Magic
Here’s what’s cookin’:
- `celsius_to_fahrenheit()` – It's gettin’ hot in here!
- `fahrenheit_to_kelvin()` - From spicy to science-y.
- `kelvin_to_celsius()` - Back to basics.
- And a few more temperature-flipping functions!

## 🤖 Future Ideas (Maybe?)
- Web UI with flames and snowflakes
- Voice-controlled conversion: “Hey Python, how cold is space?”
- Temperature jokes based on results (you know you want this)
